# bus-mall

Bus mall project for week 3 of Delta V.

This app is used to generate statistics on what products would be most popular and viable.  The results will be used to generate articles on buses and other public transportation to sell the most popular products to those individuals that see them.

The images of our products are set up on a randomizer so that no two images will appear one after the other in the succession of voting.  After the voting is completed the results are shown both in list format and in a chart and show you how many times each product was voted for and how many times that product was shown as an option.

The application also uses local storage to save the results from prior voting sessions so that each time someone goes through the voting process the new results are updated accordingly giving back a total of all voting sessions that have occured.

Thank you Craig and Ian for your persistence and ability to see us through our problems.
